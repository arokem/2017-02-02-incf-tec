### Software Carpentry

<image src="images/swc-logo.png" height=200px>

???

Another activity that serves researchers across campus are workshops that we host at the Data Science Institute on a variety of topics.

One kind of workshop that has been very popular are Software Carpentry "bootcamps"
--

Volunteer-based organization

???

Software Carpentry is a volunteer-based organization and community of practice...
--

Teaches researchers basic computing skills:

???
That teaches researchers from a variety of fields basic computing skills
--

1. How to use the Unix shell
1. Basic programming (Python/R)
1. Version control (Git/Github)
1. Sometimes also teach SQL and/or software testing.

???
How to use the unix operating shell to control their operating system, how to program in Python, or in R, how to use version control to make their research reproducible and open. Sometimes we also cover more advanced topics, such as use of data-bases, or software testing.

### Why is this worth doing?

???

You might ask: why is this worth doing? In the next couple of slides, I will argue that this is highly relevant to many of you, working at UW IT.

In a blog post that he wrote, Greg Wilson, the co-founder of Software Carpentry made three hypotheses
--

"Ask the managers of high-performance computing centers what fraction of their budget they spent on hardware, software, and training, and what fractions they would like to spend. My prediction is:"

<a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/08/three-graphs-i-would-like-to-see.html
">Greg Wilson</a>

???
The first relates to the gap between the resources that are spent on training versus the need for these resources. Arguably, the best form of future-proofing is education, and we might ask whether we are doing enough of this form of future-proofing. I don't know.

### Why is this worth doing?

"Measure how much computing power all of the scientists at a university (not just those with HPC accounts) use during a year. My prediction is:"

<image src="images/gvwilson2.png">

  <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/08/three-graphs-i-would-like-to-see.html
  ">Greg Wilson</a>

???
The second hypothesis is about the impact of this kind of training. Greg posits that many researchers at the University today are not doing high-performance computing on Big Data. Rather, they are doing mediocre-performance computing on medium data: computing things on laptops or desktops on data sets on the order of Megabytes to Gigabytes in size.
---

### Why is this worth doing?
"Classify all the support requests received by HPC center staff according to technical complexity, and see how that changes after something like a two-day Software Carpentry workshop. My prediction is:"

<image src="images/gvwilson3.png">

  <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/08/three-graphs-i-would-like-to-see.html
  ">Greg Wilson</a>

???
The last hypothesis pertains to the kinds of questions that people will ask from the IT person in their department. One of the main value propositions of training like that provided in Software Carpentry workshops is that it raises the overall complexity of the interactions that researchers and IT people can have, because it brings researchers over the initial hump of clue-lessness to where they can ask more interesting questions, and collaborate more effectively with the IT people in their department.

## Why teach Python?

--

Free

--

Open-source

--

Relatively easy to learn

--

But still tremendously powerful

---

### Two recent examples

- Tensorflow

- Apache Spark

#### Open-source science: the scientific Python eco-system

### Neuroimaging in Python

<a href="http://nipy.org/"><image src="images/nipy-logo.png" height=250px></a>

--

A community of practice

--

A series of open source projects

--

A mailing list

# Neurohackweek

--

Hackathons are a great opportunity for training

--

Short focused work on team projects provides an opportunity to learn new topics from/with other participants

--

- [Brainhack](http://brainhack.org/)

- [OHBM hackathon](http://events.brainhack.org/OHBM2016/)

--

But they also require a degree of expertise that not everyone has

--

# Neurohackweek

--

Inspired by [Astrohackweek](http://astrohackweek.org)
